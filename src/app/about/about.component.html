      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Steven and I am a full-stack software developer with over 2
        years of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in building modern, user-friendly JavaScript applications
        using frontend frameworks like React and backend technologies such as
        Node.js and Express. I'm also proficient in both SQL and NoSQL
        solutions, like MongoDB, for database management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm further expanding my skills by pursuing a Full-stack
        developer program at Humber College, where I'm adding additional
        technologies such as C#, Angular, SQL servers, and cloud computing to my
        stack.
